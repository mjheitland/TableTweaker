    <h1>TableTweaker</h1>
    (&copy;2019 Michael Heitland)
    <p>
        TableTweaker is a mighty tool to manipulate any text that has a table structure.
        <br />
        Copy and paste your table into the input field (bottom left window), use a regex to filter which input lines shall be processed, describe the transformation in the pattern field (top window)
        and check the transformed text in the output field (bottom right window).
        The output can be copied into any other program for further processing.
        <br />
        The highlight: you can use any scripted C# method you like. This program comes with a code editor supporting syntax highlighting and Intellisense to help you coding! The code gets compiled on the fly.
        <br />
        In <i>manual</i> mode you have to press F5 to run the transformation, in <i>auto</i> mode the transformation happens automatically whenever the input gets changed.
        <br />
        Set the field qualifier to <i>none</i> if you want to keep quotation marks of the input, otherwise they will be eliminated and a pair of quotation marks will be replaced by single quotation marks.
        <br />
        If you have a 1:1 mapping of one input line to one output line, you might find the Result Grid helpful that shows input and output as HTML table. That makes it easy to scroll through input and output synchronously. You can toggle between one and two column layout.
        <br />
        <h2>Initial Example: Mailing everyone from your contact list that an accident has happened</h2>
        <br />
        <h2>Keywords</h2>
        $dollar;: "$" (dollar sign)
        <br />
        $h0, $h1, ...: fields from the header row (i.e. first line of your input; index is 0-based)
        <br />
        $h-0, $h-1, ...: fields from the header row (right-most field has index -0, the next one -1 etc.)
        <br />
        $0, $1, ...: row fields (0-based)
        <br />
        $-0, $-1, ...: row fields (right-most field has index -0, the next one -1 etc.)
        <br />
        $header: first row
        <br />
        $row: current row
        <br />
        $rowNum: row number (0-based)
        <br />
        $rowNumOne: row number (1-based)
        <br />
        $numFields: number of fields per row
        <br />
        $numRows: total number of rows in the input field
        <br />
        $MyMethod("$0",$1,$row, 7, "some text", ...): call any C# method from your code window. If you use ")" within your args, pick another set of brackets instead of "(" and ")", e.g. [], <> or {}.
        <br />
        <h2>Section markers</h2>
        $ONCE: apply the pattern only once
        <br />
        $EACH: apply the pattern for every single row of the input field
        <br />
        $EACH+: apply the pattern for every single row of the input field, but skip the first row (i.e. header line)
        <br />
        <h2>Prebuilt Functions</h2>
        FormatDate: use a format string to describe how you want to have your dates displayed
        <br />
        IndexOf: searches for a pattern and returns its index within the string or -1 if not found
        <br />
        Left: returns the "n" left-most characters
        <br />
        Right: returns the "n" right-most characters
        <br />
        Replace: replace a substring with another substring
        <br />
        Substring: returns a substring 
        <br />
        ToLower: converts a string to lower case
        <br />
        ToUpper: converts a string to upper case
        <br />
        Trim: removes leading and trailing characters
